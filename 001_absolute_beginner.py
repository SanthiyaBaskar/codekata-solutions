# ğŸ§® Problem: Cube of a Number
#
# ğŸ“Œ Description:
#    Read an integer from the user and print its cube (nÂ³).
#
# ğŸ§¾ Extended Description:
#    This problem helps you practice:
#      - Taking a single integer input
#      - Using the exponentiation operator `**` in Python
#      - Understanding the cube operation: nÂ³ = n Ã— n Ã— n
#
#    This is a basic arithmetic operation often used in math-based problems.
#
# ğŸ§  Hint:
#    - Use `int(input())` to read the input
#    - Use `n ** 3` to calculate the cube
#
# âœ… Sample Input:
#    2
#
# âœ… Sample Output:
#    8

n = int(input())
cube = n ** 3
print(cube)
