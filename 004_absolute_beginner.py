# ðŸ§® Problem: Number of Days in a Month
#
# ðŸ“Œ Description:
#    Read an integer representing a month number (1 to 12).
#    Print the number of days in that month.
#    (Assume it's not a leap year â€” so February has 28 days.)
#
# ðŸ§¾ Extended Description:
#    This problem teaches how to:
#      - Work with dictionaries for lookup
#      - Validate input using conditional statements
#      - Apply real-world logic (calendar-based)
#
#    The program uses a dictionary `month_days` where the keys are month numbers (1â€“12)
#    and the values are the number of days in each respective month.
#
# ðŸ§  Hint:
#    - Use a dictionary to store days for each month
#    - Check if the month is between 1 and 12 before accessing
#

#    30

month = int(input())
month_days = {
